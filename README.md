- 👋 Hi, I’m Phil 
- 👀 I’m interested in many things, particularly the use of computers in our daily lives.
- 🌱 I’ve read a lot of sci-fi in the past and it's interesting to see how close or not forecasts have come to reality. AI in all its applications is a major interest at the moment.
- 💞️ I’m looking to learn and collaborate, if possible, on any aspects of robotics.
